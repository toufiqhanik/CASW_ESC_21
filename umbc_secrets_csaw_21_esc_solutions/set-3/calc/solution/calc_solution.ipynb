    "There are two possible attack can be applied in this operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "1# CPA attack. However, The variation is very less. Even we found some bytes but the attack is not strong enough. Also, CPA has many calculation and comperatively more execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2# Buffer overflow with addition and substraction. As soon as the buffer overflow happens there is a power drop. We are focusing ion this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#############################################\n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumtion of this attack is that buffer overflow. That will be used as the vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: A byte has the value 255 as 1111 1111. As soon as we add 1 it will be 1 0000 000. Here, The hamming weight will drop from 8 to 1. This will have a visible impact in the power. Similarly, if we substract 1 from 0000 0000 it will generate 1111 1111. There wil be similar impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as the calculator hold the memory, and we have the option to manipulate the memory by performing calculation. We can use this function to manipulate the data inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C code has a array as a int. Which is 32 bit (4 byte) and array has 3 elements. Difficulty to attack this program with brut force is 2^(32*32*32). Which is very hard or even not possible considering time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the attack, we only want to attack a byte of the array elemants. Therefor, we have only need to attck 4 byte in 4 loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1# We need to get rid of other bytes except the one we are attacking. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example: if are attcking byte 0. Then we can remove the byte 3-1 as shifting the byte 0, 3*8 times to left. This will \n",
    "    keep the byte 0 to byte3. Then as we are using lsb byte to perform the operation, we need to shift the byte0 from msb \n",
    "    byte3. We can shift it 3*8 times to right. This will only keep the byte0 in the array. However baserd on the msb bit of the \n",
    "    leftover byte it will padd 1s or 0s in other3 msb bytes. Which is a advantage for the attcker to perform buffer overflow\n",
    "    with sudden power drop/rise.        \n",
    "    Main array-->  |<byte3>|<byte2>|<byte1>|<byte0>| \n",
    "    Shift left-->  |<byte0>|<*****>|<*****>|<*****>| (Shift left can be done by multiply by 2 for one shift right)\n",
    "    Shift right->  |<*1/0*>|<*1/0*>|<*1/0*>|<byte0>| (Shift right can be done by dividing by 2 for one shift left)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2# To get a higher power drop, we need a transaction of 0000 0000 to 1111 1111 or vice versa.\n",
    "    therefor we will collect the power traces for addition of 0 to 255 as well as substraction 0 to 255.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Repeat step 1-2 for each byte and collect the power traces for each byte.\n",
    "    ##Note that, The power traces should be less noisy. Therefore we can collect the traces multiple times for same operation \n",
    "    and get the mean of thiose to decrerase the effect of noise. For our case we used 20 repeted trace collection. (Less is \n",
    "    also ok.)\n",
    "        \n",
